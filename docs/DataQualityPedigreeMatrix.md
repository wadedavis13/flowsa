# Data Quality Pedigree Mattix

The following table is an update of
'Table 3 Updated Data Quality Pedigree Matrix - Flow Indicators' from [USEPA 2016 'Guidance on Data Quality Assessment for Life Cycle Inventory Data'](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=321834)
for application to FLOWSA. Discussion of generic data quality applications across packages can be found in [esupy](https://github.com/USEPA/esupy/blob/main/DataQualityPedigreeMatrix.md).

Indicator | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Applies to |
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
DataReliability | Verified data based on measurements | Verified data based on a calculation OR non-verified data based on measurements | Non-verified data based on a calculation | Documented estimate | Undocumented estimate | [FlowByActivity](../format%20specs/FlowByActivity.md), [FlowBySector](../format%20specs/FlowBySector.md)
TemporalCorrelation | Less than 3 years of difference between source data year and target year | Less than 6 years of difference | Less than 10 years of difference | Less than 15 years of difference | Age of data unknown or more than 15 years | [FlowBySector](../format%20specs/FlowBySector.md)
GeographicalCorrelation | Data represent same FIPS code and level or higher resolution  | Data represent different FIPS code within the same level or 1 level lower resolution | Data represent different FIPS code and off two levels or 2 levels lower resolution |  Data represent different FIPS code within the same level or 3 levels lower resolution | Data geography just a proxy or unknown | [FlowBySector](../format%20specs/FlowBySector.md) |
TechnologicalCorrelation | Data represent same NAICS sector and level or higher resolution | Data have last 1 NAICSs sector difference  or 1 level lower resolution | Data have last 2 NAICS sector difference or 2 levels lower resolution | Data represent last 3 NAICS sectors off or 3 levels lower resolution  | Data represent last 4 NAICS sectors off or 4 levels lower resolution or data applied across all technologies | [FlowBySector](../format%20specs/FlowBySector.md) |
DataCollection | >= 80% of product represented or % of establishments of activities reporting | 60 <= x <= 80% of of product represented or % establishments or activities reporting | 40% >= x >= 60% of product represented or % of establishments or activities reporting | <= 40% of product represented or % of establishments or activities reporting | unknown percentage of establishments or activities reporting | [FlowByActivity](../format%20specs/FlowByActivity.md), [FlowBySector](../format%20specs/FlowBySector.md)


## Rules

1. Data can represent the original raw daw or the data used for sector allocation.
2. Allocation of amount data with data representing another flow results in a 1 point quality deduction for TechnologicalCorrelation.
3. Lack of certainty over whether an activity represents a commodity or an industry results in a 1 point quality deduction for TechnologicalCorrelation.
4. For TemporalCorrelation, year of allocation dataset is not considered, only the source data year and target year.
5. For DataCollection, percentage of production value, mass or activity is preferred over number of establishments.
6. When records are aggregated, a flow-weighted average of data quality scores is calculated.

## Notes

1. DataReliability and TemporalCorrelation are unchanged from USEPA 2016.

## Data Quality Scoring Examples

### Fictional seafood industry example

Target Data

Data Type | Time | Geography | Sector | Sample |
---|---|---|---|---|
Mass of seafood input | 2020 | CA | Seafood Product Preparation and Packaging (industry) | NA |

Source Data

Data Type | Time | Geography | Sector | Sample|
---|---|---|---|---|
Documented estimate of seafood input | ~1940 | Monterey,CA | Sardine canning | 1 establishment |

Score

DataReliability | TemporalCorrelation | GeographicalCorrelation | TechnologicalCorrelation | DataCollection |
---|---|---|---|---|
4 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 5 |

Explanation
- Data were based on an estimate that was documented (4).
- The time is ~80 years before the target date (5).
- The geography represents 1 city/town which is a higher resolution than required (for California) (1).
- Data represent a more resolved industry that required (sardine canning) (1).
- Data are only from 1 facility out of an unknown total CA industry, so it's assumed to represent a <40% (5).
