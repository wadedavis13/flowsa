# Flow-By-Sector Activity Sets
Flow-By-Sector (FBS) activity sets are an optional method of assigning Flow-By-Actiivty (FBA)
activities to an activity set defined in an FBS method yaml. Activity set csv files are generally
created in the [scripts directory](https://github.com/USEPA/flowsa/tree/master/scripts/FlowBySector_Activity_Sets).
These csvs are not required, but are recommended when an FBA has a large number of activities.
